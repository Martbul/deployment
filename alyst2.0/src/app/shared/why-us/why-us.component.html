                 Hiring in-house involves similar problems. We take a different approach: a COO-level expert
                 (Nick) on an unlimited subscription to give you the ops you need for less.</h5>

                 not long cycles. Don't pay for a 4 mo+ agency retainerâ€”get 
                 what you need with us & pause or cancel your subscription anytime.</h5>
